## sample
sample.zip is the sample set used in our experiment.

## result
result.zip contains the results of our experiment and the generated prompts.

## test
test.zip is the test set for our experiment, sourced from test.json in https://github.com/CEPROTest/CEPROT/blob/master/data/gen.zip. We obtained the complete production class before and after the update and the test class before and after the update through the GitHub repository name, file path, commit id and other information in the test.json to build the test set for our experiment.

test.json contains 520 test samples. During the process of collecting the complete class files, we found that 4 test samples corresponded to GitHub repositories that are no longer available. Therefore, our test set consists of 516 test samples. All methods that need to be updated in the experiment are recorded in test.json.
